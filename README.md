# 🏓 Retro Pong Game (Python OOP)

A classic 2-player arcade Pong game recreated using Python and the Turtle graphics library. This project demonstrates Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts by structuring game components (paddles, ball, scoreboard) into separate classes.

## 🎮 Game Overview

Two players compete in a fast-paced rally. The game tracks the score in real-time, and the match follows 
A **" BEST of 3"** format. The first player to score 3 points wins the game!

## ✨ Key Features

* **2-Player Local Multiplayer:** Play against a friend on the same keyboard.
* **OOP Architecture:** Clean code structure using classes for the Paddle, Ball, and Scoreboard.
* **Score Tracking:** Dynamic scoreboard updates after every point.
* **🏆 Game Over Logic:** The game automatically detects when a player reaches 3 points. 
  It clears the screen and displays a large **"Player [X] Wins!"** message to announce the champion.
* **Collision Detection:** Physics-based bouncing off walls and paddles.
